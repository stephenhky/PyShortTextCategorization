# Short Text Categorization in Python

This repository is a collection of algorithms for multi-class classification to short texts using Python. Modules are backward compatible unless otherwise specified. Feel free to give suggestions.

To install it, in a console, use `pip`.

```
>>> pip install -U shorttext
```

or, if you want the most updated code that is not released on PyPI yet, type

```
>>> pip install -U git+https://github.com/stephenhky/PyShortTextCategorization@master
```

Developers are advised to make sure `Keras` >=2 be installed. Users are advised to install the backend `Tensorflow` (preferred) or `Theano` in advance.

Before using, check the language model of spaCy has been installed or updated, by running:

```
>>> spacy download en
```

See [tutorial](http://shorttext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html) for how to use the package.
